These licensed programs are being provided to you under the following terms and conditions by The MathWorks, Inc. (hereinafter "MathWorks") a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick, MA.

Upon your agreement to these terms, indicated by clicking the acceptance button below, you are hereby granted a temporary and limited license to receive, review, and use the contents ("the Prerelease"), which includes certain computer programs, documentation, or other technical or business information in various stages of development (including a beta or other prerelease version) which MathWorks considers to be proprietary.  The Prerelease is a commercially valuable, unpublished product of MathWorks, the design and development of which reflect the efforts of skilled development experts and the investment of considerable time and expense.  The Prerelease is based on substantial trade secrets of MathWorks, and MathWorks claims and reserves all rights and benefits afforded under federal copyright law (and international copyright treaties) in the Prerelease as an unpublished work.  All right, title, and interest in and to the Prerelease is retained by MathWorks and is disclosed to you only in accordance with the terms of this agreement.  The limited right conferred by this agreement is nontransferable and is revocable at will by MathWorks.  Although MathWorks is considering a commercial release of the Prerelease, it is under no obligation to do so and MathWorks reserves the right to alter features, licensing terms, or other characteristics of any such commercial release.

1.  The Prerelease is provided to you solely for your internal review, testing, and evaluation.  You agree to test and evaluate the Prerelease, to furnish the results of such testing and evaluation to MathWorks, and to respond to inquiries from MathWorks regarding your use of the Prerelease in accordance with the limitations herein.

2.  You consequently agree to ensure that all of your personnel or agents afforded access to the Prerelease protect such material against any improper use.  You agree that only backup copies may be made of the Prerelease or any portion thereof and that you shall not reverse engineer or decompile the object code of the Prerelease into source code.

3.  This license shall terminate upon the earliest of a) the conclusion of your evaluation of the Prerelease, b) commercial release of the Prerelease, or c) the written demand of MathWorks.  

4.  THE PRERELEASE SHALL BE DELIVERED "AS IS".  THE PRERELEASE RELIES ON PROTOTYPE, TIME-SENSITIVE, UNSUPPORTED SOFTWARE THAT MAY NOT OPERATE CORRECTLY. MATHWORKS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PRERELEASE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL MATHWORKS BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS.

5.  The Prerelease contains technology for the prevention of its unlicensed or illegal use.  The Prerelease requires activation to exercise your limited rights under this agreement.  You may also need to activate if you redesignate the individual programs selected from those available under the Prerelease, or if you modify your computer hardware.  Activation associates the use of the Prerelease with a specific computer.  During activation, MathWorks will obtain data about the Prerelease and the computer.  This data includes the license information, computer identification and location.  A license file will be provided for the licensed computer to complete activation.
